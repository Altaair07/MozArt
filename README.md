MozArt is here to explore museums and galleries in Jakarta, where you will get the experience and beauty of visiting museums and galleries directly just by using your lovely smartphone. We provide several features such as recognizing an image to give information for objects, the existence of museums around us, galleries that are currently in progress, etc. Therefore, for a better experience, MozArt provides a feature to see the objects in the museum as a trial for visitors before going directly to the museum.

## Features of MozArt

- Image Detection: Implement a robust image detection feature using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate picture analysis.
- Classification Algorithm: Utilize a classification algorithm in conjunction with CNN to categorize detected images and provide relevant information based on the classification results.
- Android App Development: Develop the mobile application using Kotlin and Android Studio, incorporating camera functionalities through CameraX for image scanning.
- Integration of Machine Learning Model: Integrate the TensorFlow Lite model into the Android app, allowing seamless implementation of the machine learning model for image detection.
- Cloud Storage for ML Model: Utilize Google Cloud Storage to store and serve the machine learning model, ensuring efficient access and updates.
- API Connectivity: Establish an API using JavaScript (Node.js with Express.js or Flask) to connect the mobile application with the machine learning model, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.
- Deployment on Google Cloud Functions: Deploy the API to Google Cloud Functions for scalability and efficient handling of backend processes.
- Backend API for Mobile App: Implement a backend API for the mobile application to handle requests and responses, enabling dynamic interactions between the frontend and backend components.
