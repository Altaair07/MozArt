In this project, we have developed a model designed to detect images and identify the specific painting that a user is showcasing. The model incorporates a transfer learning approach, leveraging the InceptionV3 model. We enhance our accuracy through fine-tuning method.

And than we train our model with 100 epoch and 10 epoch for fine tuning

After that we got result like this :
